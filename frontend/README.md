# Frontend

The frontend was an exercise in vibe coding. The initial configuration and setup was done by me but some of the coding was done with the assistance of AI, and is not intended to be the most production ready. For recruiters or future employers: I DO know React, and you can check out my GitHub for some projects that are more complex.

Overall, it was very cool to practice leveraging AI for some of the less fun parts.
